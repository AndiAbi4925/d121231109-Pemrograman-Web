        As OCVP Marketing for STEP 2025 by AIESEC in Unhas, I lead the development and execution of marketing strategies to promote a youth-oriented initiative that empowers participants to explore global career opportunities and personal growth. My role involves creating compelling campaigns across digital and offline platforms to enhance visibility, attract participants, and engage stakeholders. By collaborating with cross-functional teams, I ensure that marketing initiatives align with project objectives and organizational goals. Through data-driven insights and innovative storytelling, I contribute to strengthening the event’s outreach, fostering community engagement, and amplifying AIESEC’s impact on youth development.
