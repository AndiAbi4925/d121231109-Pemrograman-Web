I created engaging promotional content and managed communication channels to increase visibility and reach. By collaborating with functional teams, I helped ensure the smooth execution of recruitment strategies while also supporting applicant tracking, interviews, and onboarding to enhance the candidate experience. Additionally, I contributed to team meetings and initiatives that strengthened outreach and fostered member engagement.
