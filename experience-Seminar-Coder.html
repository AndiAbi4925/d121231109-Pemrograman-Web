        <p class="description">
          I led the media design and documentation efforts for a seminar, taking charge of creating promotional graphics, event brochures, and presentation slides that aligned with the seminar’s theme and objectives. By applying design principles such as color theory, composition, and typography, I was able to deliver professional and visually appealing content that elevated the overall experience. During the event, I also managed on-site documentation by coordinating with the team to capture key moments—including keynote speeches, panel discussions, and networking sessions—ensuring all valuable content was preserved for post-event use.
